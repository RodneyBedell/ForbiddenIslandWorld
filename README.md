# ForbiddenIslandWorld
A Java game in which you must escape the Forbidden Island World

You are stranded on an island and must find all the parts to repair your helicopter before the island sinks underwater. 

Arrow Keys to move.
M, T, and R keys let you switch the terrain between a regular smooth mountain, a rocky mountain island with varying heights, and a semi-randomly generated island.
There is also a scuba tank on the island. Once found, using it with the F key allows you to swim under water for short periods of time.
